# This test searches for $1-config in the path $2.
# The search path defaults to ${prefix}/bin:$PATH.
#
#
# The config var ${1}_config is exported, and will contain the path of
# the config app or empty if it was not found. Note that any "-"
# characters in $1 are converted to "_" for this purpose. 

# FIND_APPCONFIG is also exported to the path of the found config app,
# but will be reset on each call to this function. It is intended to
# be helpful when running this test in loops, e.g., for x in foo bar;
# do ... done

# Example:
#
#    toc_test_require find_appconfig my-lib
#
# will search for my-lib-config in ${prefix}/bin:$PATH
# and will export ${my_lib_config} to the path where it
# is found.

first argument, and an optional PATH as it's second argument.

    toc_test_require find_appconfig gtk
