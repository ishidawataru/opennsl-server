@mainpage libs11n API docs

Author/Maintainer: stephan beal <stephan@s11n.net>

Home page: http://s11n.net/

Development mailing list: s11n-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Please feel free to contact the mailing list or the maintainer directly
with any feedback or questions.

An overview of the libraries:

- s11n: an object serialization framework. It provides a powerful,
flexible, easy-to-use interface for serializing a wide variety
of data types.

- s11nlite: the "lite" interface to libs11n. New s11n users are HIGHLY
encouraged to start in the s11nlite namespace.

ACHTUNG: These API docs are supplemented by the library manual.
They explain the details of the API, but not how to use the API
in client code. The library manual fills those gaps. Please look over
the library manual before attempting to use this framework.
