========================================================================
This is the INSTALL file for libs11n (s11n).
http://s11n.net
maintainer: stephan@s11n.net
========================================================================

ACHTUNG:

While the core code is not platorm specific, the build tree and
configure script are *quite* GNU-specific, and REQUIRE "recent"
versions of the most common GNU tools, like sed, GNU make, GNU tar,
gzip, etc. Complete docs for the build tree can be found on the build
tool's home page:

        http://toc.sourceforge.net

(shameless plug: i wrote that, too ;)

s11n uses a conventional 'configure' script, which is run like so:

        ./configure [--options]

Run it with --help to see the complete list of options. None are
normally necessary, but setting a prefix is required if you want
to install s11n as a non-root user:

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME
(i.e., somewhere to which you have write access)

If configure finds problems then you won't be able to build s11n
without manual intervention - feel free to contact us if you
have build problems.

After configuring, simply:

        make
        make install

Files are installed under:

        PREFIX/bin (compiled bins and scripts)
        PREFIX/lib (libraries)
        PREFIX/include/s11n (headers)
        PREFIX/share/doc/s11n (API and library manual)


After installing s11n you must make sure it's lib directory
is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or in /etc/ld.so.conf) in order
for s11n client applications to be able to link to them.

Use the libs11n-config tool to get information about the installed s11n
version, including version information and information necessary for
compiling/linking against it as a client.


========================================================================
Misc notes:

If you have the 'lyx' tool installed (and configure found it) you
can build the library manual:

        cd doc; make lyx

If configure finds the doxygen [API doc generation tool] you can build
the API docs with:

        cd doc/doxygen; make doxygen

The API docs are automatically created at install time if
configure finds doxygen. You can get doxygen at:

        http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
