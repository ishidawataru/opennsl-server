# Source tree configure script, toc-style.
# The latest code is at http://toc.sourceforge.net/
#
# Do not run this directly: wrap it up in a script called 'configure', 
# stick it into your top-level build tree, set some environment vars,
# and source it. See the configure from the toc distribution for a
# quick starting point.
#
# Requires the the Bourne Again SHell, GNU Make, plus a skew of other open-source utilities
# which are typically installed on any Unix-type system.
#
# $Revision: 1.2 $
#
# This whole thing is subject to change at any minute.
#
# Notes about this configure process:
# Project-wide vars are currently defined in:
# - this file
# - toc.${PACKAGE_NAME}.make.at
# - And check the top-level Makefile, to be certain :/
#
#
# Any options you pass on the command line, like:
#  ./configure --prefix=/opt
# will be filtered through the shared makefile and config.h.
#
# This tool still requires quite a few things, but it will not aim to be all things
# to all projects. Customize as you see fit.
#
# Note: there are no guarantees that any exit codes mean anything specific!
