This is the README for libreadline++

readline++ is a C++ front-end to the excellent GNU libreadline,
providing the basic libreadline functionality through a C++
interface. It can also function without libreadline, and linking it
without libreadline affects the license under which it is
released. See the LICENSE file for details.
