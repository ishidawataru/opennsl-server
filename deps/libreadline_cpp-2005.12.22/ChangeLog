This is the informal ChangeLog for libreadline_cpp.

22 Dec 2005:

- Added support for the "genuine" libedit, available from:
    http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/
  Only tested with the 2.9 release.


26 Feb 2005:

- Some minor internal cleanups. For libeditline mode
  added default binding of ^W to ed-delete-prev-word
  (was delete to begin of line).

- Fixed a bug in the init of editline mode: it wasn't
  going through out customization.


20 Dec 2004:

- Minor tweak to accomodate a fix in libeditline.


29 Nov 2004:

- Accommodated changes in libeditline.


27 Nov 2004:

- Now optionally uses liblineedit over libreadline, if found.
  This clears up licensing problems, as liblineedit is BSD,
  not GNU.


4 Sept 2004:

- Ported Readline_s11n to use s11n::node_traits.


7 June 2004:

- Fixed bug in serialization of Readline: history list
was only saving first token of each entry.
